            <h4>By Daniel Righter - 10/14/21</h4>
            
            <p> For my second post, I decided to take some time to discuss an idea for what I would like my final project to be if we are asked to make a website. I'm not entirely sure how 
                 practical a website like "Gamerplan" would actually be since it is a very ambituous prospect. The idea of creating a platform that combines the functions of several different 
                applications including discord and metafy so that users only need to go to one place to get the whole package seems like a no-brainer at first and that something like this should 
                already exist. However, this mindset clearly does not consider <strong>why</strong> something like this doesn't exist: if it were possible / practical, it would already be done. 
                Despite all of this, I think that creating a website that is at least functional and keeps the vision of what "Gamerplan" could be sounds like fun and I would love to give it my 
                best shot!
