    <h1>Work Experience</h1>
    <p>Throughout my college career, I have worked multiple jobs that have honed my skills in Information Technology including Application Support as well as IT Site Support. 
        My plan after graduating (next week!) is to work as a Windows System Administrator in Chicago. Below is a short list of some of the responsibilities I have held in my prior 
        jobs that demonstrate my knowledge and skills in technology:  
    </p>

    <ul> 
        <li>Resolved hardware, software, and connectivity issues at multiple industrial plants throughout Michigan</li>
        <li>Worked in an administrative role on software platforms including Office 365 and Box</li>
        <li>Managed global users on a hybrid Active Directory</li>
    </ul>



    <h1>Video Game Experience</h1>
    <p> Since 2019, one of my newest hobbies has become playing video games competitively. The two main video games that I have played and have seen competitive success are 
        Call of Duty Warzone for the PC and Super Smash Bros Ultimate on the Nintendo Switch. I have attended tournaments for these games both locally and online and have even won 
        cash prizes for my performance on Smash Ultimate.
